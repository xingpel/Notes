##Principles of Analytic Graphics
==================================
###Principle 1: Show comparisons
* Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis.
* Always ask "Compared to What?"

###Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
* What is your casusal framework for thinking about a question?

###Principle 3: Show multivariate data
* Multivariate = more than 2 variables
* The real world is multivariate
* Need to "escape flatland"

###Principle 4: Integration of evidence
* Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
* Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
* Don`t let the tool drive the analysis

###Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
* A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible

###Principle 6: Content is King
* Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content
